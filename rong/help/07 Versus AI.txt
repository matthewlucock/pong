In Versus AI mode you play against the computer. The difficulty setting simply determines how good the computer is at predicting where the ball will go. You control the paddle on the left, with the controls detailed in the controls section of the help. You win if you manage to get to 10 points, a point being the ball passing the edge of the screen past your opponent’s paddle, and you lose if your opponent gets 10 points.
