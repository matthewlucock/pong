Free movement is rather self-explanatory. When this is enabled, in addition to moving vertically, the players may also move horizontally, and rotate their paddles, to move anywhere within their half of the screen, using the controls detailed in the controls section of the help.

It is worth noting that, even if you enable free movement in Versus AI mode, the AI player will still only move vertically.
