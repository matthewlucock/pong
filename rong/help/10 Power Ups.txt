Power ups are designed to add an extra dimension to the Rong gameplay.

If power ups are enabled, then, every so often, a circle with an icon on it may appear in the game. In order to use the power up, hit the ball into it. Some of them will be global, meaning that it doesn't matter who hit the ball into it, but for some, the power granted will specifically effect the player which last hit it, or their opponent. All of their effects are temporary, and all except for lock opponent rotation and lock opponent position are cumulative.
