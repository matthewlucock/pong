If you know what you are doing:
    This game requires python 35 and pillow.
    Ensure both of these are installed, and run start.py using that.

Otherwise when first starting:
    You are going to have to be using windows. Sorry.

    Get the python 35 installer from here:
        https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2.exe
    Download that, then,
    Run python-3.5.2.exe to install Python 3.5.
    Ensure that you check the add Python35 to path check box,
    and install python in C:\Python35.
    To do this, you will need to click custom installation,
    And change the directory to C:\Python35.
    Also, ensure that pip is being installed, on the list of components to install.
    Providing you do not change anything other than the directory,
    The installation settings should be fine.
    So, next, install Python35.
    Once you have done that, run setup.bat,
    This will install pillow, our image library.

    After this, you should be able to start the game with start.bat,
    or with start.py.
